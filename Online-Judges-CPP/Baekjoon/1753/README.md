# Shortest Path
## Solution

<summary><b>SPOILERS</b></summary>

**Dijkstra Algorithm** is a very good algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. You must use `priority_queue`, not a normal `queue` for the Dijkstra algorithm!!! With just `queue`, you cannot greedily search the shortest path or upgrade some later shorter path for the algorithm.
