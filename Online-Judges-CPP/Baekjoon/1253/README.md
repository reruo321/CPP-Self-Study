Using two pointers that point to the start/end of the whole set + Selecting a number to compare with the addition of the start and the end, find the sets that are equal to the target number. For example, in {1, 2, 3}, we can get an answer pair when selecting 3 as a target number and pointing 1 and 2 as start/end pointers.

### Note
The number to compare with the addition MUST NOT BE the same as the start/end numbers to add. The number in this case must be excluded to filter some answer candidate pairs.
