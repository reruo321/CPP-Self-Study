<summary><b>SPOILERS</b></summary>

Manage the list of the best n good numbers with a priority queue, which sorts a struct of good numbers, `Goodnum`, in descending order. (Worst becomes the top.) Pop out the worst one if the queue has more than n elements. After checking all numbers, move all contents of queue to a vector and print them in ascending order.

### Notes
* Suppose that some numbers in S `s1` and `s2` has difference by 2. For example, S = {s1, s2} where s1 = 10, s2 = 12.
