## Finding Substring
Here are algorithms to find the index of substring in a string.

(n: the length of string, m: the length of pattern)

### Naive Algorithm
The simplest, using brute force approach. O(n-m+1).
### KMP
### Finite Automata
### Boyer Moore
#### The Bad Character Rule
#### The Good Suffix Rule
