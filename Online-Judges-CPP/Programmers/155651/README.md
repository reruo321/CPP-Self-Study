# [155651] Minimum Hotel Rooms
Find the minimum number of hotel rooms required for book scheduling.

Suppose that:
1. `book_time` is the 2D vector that shows the list of hotel booking times.
2. A booking time `book_time[i]` is given like this: \["HH:MM", "HH:MM"\], meaning \[`BOOKING_START_TIME`, `BOOKING_END_TIME`\].
3. Time format: `string` ("HH:MM"), from "00:00" to "23:59"
4. `BOOKING_START_TIME` < `BOOKING_END_TIME`.
5. No booking after midnight.
7. 
8. 

I was using somewhat silly algorithm for this and other similar problems, so I want to share one of good solutions.
