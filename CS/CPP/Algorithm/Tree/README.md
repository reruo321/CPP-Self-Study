## Binary Tree
All nodes in a binary tree can have their children maximum two.

### Complete Binary Tree
All nodes in a complete binary tree have two children.
### Binary Search Tree
1. Binary Tree
2. Value of all left subtree nodes must be smaller than their root value, and value of all right subtree nodes must be bigger than their root value.
## Heap Sort
O(nlogn)

1. Binary Heap
2. 
## Red-Black Tree
1. Binary Search Tree
2. Every node is elther red or black.
3. All NIL nodes are considered black.
4. All red nodes do not have any red child.
