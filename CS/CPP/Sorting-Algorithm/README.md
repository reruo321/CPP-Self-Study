# Sorting Algorithms in C++
Time Complexity:
1. O(n^2)
  * Insertion Sort
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
2. O(nlog(n))
  * Quick Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Heap Sort
  * Introspective Sort

## A. O(n^2)
### 1. Insertion Sort
Pick an element and put it into the adaquate place.

### 2. Bubble Sort
Change two elements.

### 3. Selection Sort

## B. O(nlog(n))
### 1. Quick Sort
Use pivot & divide-and-conquer.

#### Pivot Selection


### 2. Merge Sort
Use divide-and-conquer.

### 3. Heap Sort
**Heap** is a tree-based data structure.

### 4. Introspective Sort
Hybrid sorting altorithm that is used in the Standard C++ Library. It combines the strengths of quick sort, heap sort, and insertion sort.
