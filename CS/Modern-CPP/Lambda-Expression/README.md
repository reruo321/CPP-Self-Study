# Lambda Expression
`C++ 11` introduced **lambda expression**. It is a way of defining an inline function that does not need a name (anonymous), so useful for defining a simple function being used for only once.

It enables C++ programmers to do the similar thing like the functional programming.

## Definition

## Functional Programming
One of the concepts of the functional programming is "functions are first-class objects". They can be arguments of other functions, can be returned from functions, or stored in data sttuctures. However, functions are not the first-class objects in the traditional C++ programming. Therefore, to imitate the functional programming in C++, use the lambda expression! You can use it for several other functions, such as `map` and `for_each`.
